## Project description

This is the dashboard where the Supplier can add, remove and control the sellings of their goods.
It is also the entry point for the ADMIN in order to moderate and keep track of the whole system.
In the end it is the management system of the backend.

It is divided into two main parts:

    1. The supplier view: in which the supplier can compute all its needs
    2. The admin view: in which there is a part for analytis and the other for management of the different suppliers and their need.
